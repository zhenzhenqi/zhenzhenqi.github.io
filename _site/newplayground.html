                    <h2>Curatorial Statement</h2>
                    <p>This exhibition highlights selected works from the artist, and utilizes digital media as a playground. Humorous yet profound, Richard Jochum’s work creates a temporary space and time. It enables audiences to leave behind immediate reality, and to observe, play, shape, and be shaped by a new opening in return. At a time that seems to be increasingly fragmented, Jochum’s work invites us to come together and play. “I think art continually has to create new images for he time we live in. For the conditions and issues we deal with: existentially, politically, physically, and globally. Searching such images is what I am aiming for. My artistic work is often based on participation or embedded in local communities. I believe in an intriguing encounter between art producers and the public. Audiences can make us learn better and see things we would not have known yet. I understand both intelligence and creativity to be profoundly social."</p>
                    
                    <p>For The New Playground exhibition hosted at the New Media Artspace at Baruch College, the artist will exhibit a suite of four works completed between 2001 and 2017:<br /><br />
                    <img src="/assets/newplayground/Halt2001_RichardJochum.jpg" class="img-responsive" /><strong>Halt (2001)</strong> shows an artist climb a tree, sit on a branch, and pick up a saw in order to saw himself off the branch he sits on. He falls and lands on the same bough. The video is accompanied by sounds: birds twittering, sawing noises, and branch cracking.
                    

<img src="/assets/newplayground/Snow2008_RichardJochum1.png" class="img-responsive" /><strong>Snow II (2008)</strong> shows how the artist is rolling a ball of snow until he gets exhausted. The ball is growing and continues to grow after help arrives. But there is a limit to it; soon the group of helpers is bigger than the ball, thus making progress impossible.
                    <br /><br />

<img src="/assets/newplayground/20AD_GroupBark1_RichardJochum.jpg" class="img-responsive" /><strong>Twenty Angry Dogs (2010)</strong> is a video and sound installation in which 12 performers bark like angry dogs. The selection comprises a group of people that is diverse in terms of age, race, gender, or profession. 12 screens are arranged in a circle, each playing an individual video. Viewers are encouraged to walk into the center of the circle to watch the looped videos. The site-specific piece has been installed using different set-ups and equipment. An additional separate video shows the group of performers barking together in “Group-Bark”. The installation reflects the relationship between humans and animals, and the raw emotional power that we all carry in us.<br /><br />

<img src="/assets/newplayground/Catch_RichardJochum.jpg" class="img-responsive" /><strong>Catch (2017)</strong>alludes to the childhood game of two people tossing cell phones between each other. The videos recorded by each of the two phones during the playful game are shown next to each other as a projection. Referring to a pervasive selfie culture, the recordings capture the players and their environment in topsy-turvy slow motion.
