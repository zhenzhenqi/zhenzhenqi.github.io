					<p>About The Book</p>
					<p>An urgent, illuminating exploration of the social nature of shame and of how it might be used to promote large-scale political change and social reform.<br><br>In cultures that champion the individual, guilt is advertised as the cornerstone of conscience. But while guilt holds individuals to personal standards, it is powerless in the face of corrupt institutions. In recent years, we as consumers have sought to assuage our guilt about flawed social and environmental practices and policies by, for example, buying organic foods or fair-trade products. Unless nearly everyone participates, however, the impact of individual consumer consciousness is ineffective.</p>
