				<h1>LIGHT CUBES</h1>
				<p>A pair of light cubes that 24h/7d connect to each other, using the brightness as a symbol. Each light receives measurement of the other light’s ambiance brightness via internet connection and replicates it inside its own cubic shade.</p>
				<p>This project is an attempt to create an honest exchange between two extended human existence. Once in a while, we get into situations where the matter at hand evolves beyond our own comprehension. Lacking words to describe thoughts and feelings, light becomes a non-filtered confession, comfort of trust, and symbol of unconditional support. You can check the prototype testing video here.</p>
				<p>This project is still under developement, but you can click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksl8l1kW34Y" target="_blank">here</a> to check out the working prototype video.</p>
